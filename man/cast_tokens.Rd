\usage{
cast_tokens(tokens, by, id, collapse_id = F, columns = NULL,
  rm.na = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{tokens}{A tokenIndex with rsyntax annotations}

\item{by}{A list or named vector to specify the grouping elements, where names are columns and values are values in the columns. For example, if there are 
"quotes" and "clauses" columns, that have "source" and "subject" respectively, use c(quotes = "source", clauses = "subject").}

\item{id}{The name of the column the contains the ids/codes of the groups. By default, each unique code is casted to a subsentence. Alternatively,
if the id column contains text instead of unique codes, the collapse_id argument can be used to collapse the text into an id.}

\item{collapse_id}{see id}

\item{columns}{Optionally, specify which column from 'tokens' will be included in the output. If NULL, all columns are returned, but it is recommended 
to specify only the columns that you want to use for clarity.}

\item{rm.na}{drop NA's}
}
\value{
a tokenindex
