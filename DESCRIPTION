Description: Various functions for querying and reshaping dependency trees, 
    as for instance created with the spacyr, udpipe or coreNLP packages.
    This enables the automatic extraction of usefull semantic relations from texts,
    such as quotes (who said what) and clauses (who did what). Method proposed in 
    Van Atteveldt et al. (2017) <doi:10.1017/pan.2016.12>.
