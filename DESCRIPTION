Description: Various functions for querying and reshaping dependency trees, 
    as for instance created with the 'spacyr' or 'udpipe' packages.
    This enables the automatic extraction of useful semantic relations from texts,
    such as quotes (who said what) and clauses (who did what). Method proposed in 
    Van Atteveldt et al. (2017) <doi:10.1017/pan.2016.12>.
